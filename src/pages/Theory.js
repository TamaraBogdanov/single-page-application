							`Reflecting on this week's lectures and videos significantly enhanced my understanding of net art and its reliance on the web as a medium. I learned that net art isn't just about being distributed online but about leveraging the internet's unique characteristics to convey depth, meaning, and intention. These works should harness the web as a medium, drawing inspiration from it to create pieces that send a message or cement their significance in the technological era.`,

							`
							As I work on my net art piece, I plan to incorporate these insights and focus on the media aspects and modalities to craft an engaging, sensorial experience for users. Since my technical medium of display will be a laptop screen, I need to design my artwork to best suit this format. Additionally, I will use semiotic modalities to interact with this media type, ensuring my artwork fully utilizes its potential. I will need to focus on designing an artwork that sends a message,that really encapsulates this technological era and utilizes my media modalities.
							`,
							`In addition to exploring net art, my journey with React has been steadily progressing. This week, we dived into the fundamentals of Components and Props. Alongside this degree, I'm also taking a React Udemy course to deepen my understanding. While it's challenging to move beyond the basics and pass props in more complex scenarios, I'm gradually getting accustomed to React's unique functionality, especially coming from a background in basic JavaScript. By the looks of it, React will be a pleasure to work with`,

							`Studying these comcepts of  interactivity and hypermedia this week hasreally shown be the relationship between user and devices. It's fascinating to see how digital media, especially through platforms like the World Wide Web, transforms information access and interaction. 

							Using all of the visions of Singer, Bush, Borges and Nelson we are able to dissect navigation and structure in how to truly create a piece for the best possible user experience. 
							`,

							`I have begun looking at themes, layouts and inspirations for my site. Im still unsure of what kind of netart I will create but once ive settled on a theme it will be easier for me to come up with. Themes ive considered thusfar are space, animals, recipe books as well as exploration. Im not really sure about the space theme since we have already worked with this theme last year. 
							None the less, I would like my site to appear modern and neat. Nothing too fancy but nothing too basic. Im even planning on going onto Wix and creating multiple layouts, then wireframing them as my ideas. 
							`,
							`On the practical side of things, we have just reached States and Management within React. Honestly, compared to my couse on Udemy we are really rushing into these important concepts in class. I understand that there isnâ€™t enough time and lectures to dive into depth, but luckily I have my other courses as well as research to help back up the content we have been learning. `,
